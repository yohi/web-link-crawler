# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A web crawler script that takes a website URL as input and recursively explores links within that site to output a comprehensive list. The system efficiently crawls pages within the specified domain and outputs all discovered links in a structured format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input a website URL and get all links found on that site recursively, so that I can analyze the site structure and discover all available pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid URL is provided THEN the system SHALL start crawling from that URL
2. WHEN crawling a page THEN the system SHALL extract all href links from anchor tags
3. WHEN a link is found THEN the system SHALL add it to the crawling queue if it belongs to the same domain
4. WHEN all pages are crawled THEN the system SHALL output a complete list of discovered URLs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the crawler to respect the same domain boundary, so that it doesn't crawl external websites unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a discovered link THEN the system SHALL check if it belongs to the same domain as the starting URL
2. WHEN a link is external THEN the system SHALL record it but not crawl it further
3. WHEN a link is internal THEN the system SHALL add it to the crawling queue
4. WHEN determining domain boundaries THEN the system SHALL handle subdomains appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to avoid infinite loops and duplicate processing, so that the crawler completes efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a URL is encountered THEN the system SHALL check if it has already been processed
2. WHEN a URL has been processed THEN the system SHALL skip it to avoid duplicates
3. WHEN crawling depth becomes excessive THEN the system SHALL have configurable limits
4. WHEN circular references exist THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the output to be well-formatted and informative, so that I can easily understand the site structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN outputting results THEN the system SHALL display URLs in a readable format
2. WHEN showing results THEN the system SHALL indicate the depth level of each URL
3. WHEN crawling is complete THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL report them clearly without stopping the entire process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the crawler to handle various edge cases gracefully, so that it works reliably across different websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering HTTP errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with other URLs
2. WHEN parsing malformed HTML THEN the system SHALL extract what it can and continue
3. WHEN network timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN rate limiting is needed THEN the system SHALL implement delays between requests

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure crawler behavior, so that I can adapt it to different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the crawler THEN the system SHALL accept command-line arguments for configuration
2. WHEN setting max depth THEN the system SHALL respect the specified crawling depth limit
3. WHEN setting delay THEN the system SHALL wait the specified time between requests
4. WHEN setting output format THEN the system SHALL support different output formats (text, JSON, CSV)
